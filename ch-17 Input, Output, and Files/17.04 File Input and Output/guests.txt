Letâ€™s look at a program that appends data to the end of a file.The program maintains a file
that contains a guest list.When the program begins, it displays the current contents of the
file, if it exists. It can use the is_open() method after attempting to open the file to check
whether the file exists. Next, the program opens the file for output, using the
ios_base::app mode.Then it solicits input from the keyboard to add to the file. Finally,
the program displays the revised file contents. Listing 17.18 illustrates how to accomplish
these goals. Note how the program uses the is_open() method to test whether the file
has been opened successfully
